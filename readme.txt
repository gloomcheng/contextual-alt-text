This plugin allows you to automatically generate an Alt Text for images uploaded into the media library via AI.

== Description ==

This plugin enables the automatic creation of alt text for images uploaded to the media library directly at the time of upload.

To generate the alt text, you can choose to utilize the artificial intelligence of OpenAI or Azure, or decide if you simply want to copy the title of the article where the image is uploaded or the name of the image.

Clearly, using artificial intelligence will allow for a more accurate and useful alt text.

## Features
___
This plugin allows you to generate alt texts in the following ways:
- using Azure APIs for computational vision;
- using Openai APIs
- recovering the title of the image
- recovering the title of the article in which the image is uploaded

= Getting Started =
After installing the plugin, click on the 'Auto Alt Text' menu item.

## Choice of Generation Method
Select the Generation Method you prefer

### Azure's APIs
On your Azure account, create a Computer Vision instance and retrieve the following data to enter on the options page:
- Computer Vision API Key
- Computer Vision Endpoint

If you want to generate an alt text in English, save the options without filling in any other fields.

If you want to generate an alt text in a different language, on your Azure account, create a Translator instance and retrieve the following data to enter on the options page:
- Translator Instance API Key
- Translator Instance Endpoint
- Translator Instance Region

After entering this data, save the options.

Select the desired language and save the options again.

### OpenAI's APIs
In your OpenAI account, retrieve the following data to enter on the options page:
- API Key

Enter a prompt for generating the alt text according to your needs.

Select a Fallback OpenAI Model, useful in case the automatic generation of alt text does not work correctly.

For generating alt text, the "gpt-4-vision-preview" model is used, which is currently in preview. Therefore, it might sometimes return an error.

When the model fails, a fallback model is used to create the alt text based on the name of the image.

Enter the fallback prompt.

### Title of the article
For this generation method, there are no options to set as the alt text will be generated by copying the title of the article in which the image is uploaded.

In case the article is not uploaded as an attachment of an article, the "Title of the attachment" method will be used as a fallback.

### Title of the attachment
For this generation method, there are no options to set as the alt text will be generated by copying the title of the image.

## Functioning
Once the plugin is configured, each time an image is uploaded to the media library, an alt text will be automatically set based on the selected generation method.

**Notice**: If you choose one of the methods that involves the use of external APIs, the upload times for images in the media library might increase because it requires sending a request to the APIs, waiting for the external server to process, and waiting for a response.

In case of an error in the API call, the image will still be uploaded but without alt text as usual. In this case, the cause of the error can be seen on the Auto Alt Text -> Error log page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it mandatory to use external AI services? =
No, but if you want to leverage the capabilities of AI, you must have an Azure or OpenAI account. Otherwise, you can choose one of the two methods that do not use AI.

= Which generation method should I choose to obtain an accurate description of the image? =
If you wish to obtain the most accurate description possible of the image, you should use the "OpenAI's APIs" or "Azure's APIs" method.
