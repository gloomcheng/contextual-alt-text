## [v3.0.0] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added

- **HuggingFace AI Provider Support**: Added complete HuggingFace integration as a cost-effective alternative to OpenAI/Azure, including support for various text and vision models.
- **Context-Aware Generation**: Implemented context-aware alt text generation that can analyze surrounding post content (title, content, categories, and tags).
- **Enhanced Multilingual Support**:
  - Direct AI generation in target languages (no translation needed).
  - Added Traditional Chinese (zh_TW) language pack.
- **Accessibility Focus**: Added explicit information in documentation on how the plugin helps meet WCAG 1.1.1.
- **Advanced Configuration**: Added more flexible options for separating Text and Vision AI providers and managing API keys individually.
- **Technical**: Added HuggingFace-specific exception handling for better error management.

### Changed

- **Major Refactor & Rebrand**: Forked from `auto-alt-text` and officially rebranded as `Contextual Alt Text`.
- **Codebase Restructure**:
  - Updated the entire codebase to use the new `contextual-alt-text` slug.
  - Refactored all PHP namespaces to `ContextualAltText`.
  - Renamed all constants, database options, and asset handles to use the `CAT_` prefix.
- **UI/UX Improvements**: Enhanced admin interface with clearer configuration options and provider-specific guides.
- **Documentation**: Overhauled `readme.txt` and other documentation to reflect new branding and features.
- **Dependencies**: Updated `package.json` and `composer.json` with correct author and repository information.

## [v2.4.2] - 2025-06-21 (Original)

### Changed

- Modify documentation and build again the assets

## [v2.4.1] - 2025-06-18

### Changed

- Fixed: Alt text now correctly persists when generated from both the post media overlay and the main Media Library.

## [v2.4.0] - 2025-06-15

### Changed

- Introduce two new plugin-specific constants, `AATXT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `AATXT_ENCRYPTION_SALT`, allowing API keys to be encrypted independently of WordPress's own salts.
- Implement automatic migration of existing encrypted API keys: on upgrade, keys encrypted with the old WP salts are decrypted (if possible) and re-encrypted with the new plugin key.
- Add an optional info notice on the Auto Alt Text options page showing the ready-to-copy `define()` statements for `wp-config.php`.
- Maintain full backward-compatibility: if the new constants are not defined, the plugin continues to use the WordPress `LOGGED_IN_KEY`/`LOGGED_IN_SALT` fallback without interruption.

## [v2.3.4] - 2025-06-13

### Changed

- Displays an error message in the administration area if the WordPress salt keys were changed after the OpenAI API key was set. The message asks the user to enter the OpenAI API key again.
